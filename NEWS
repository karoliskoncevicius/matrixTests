Package: matrixTests
====================

Version 0.2 [TBD]

BUG FIXES:

 * Waerden and Flinger-Killeen tests no longer produce NA results when a whole group has only NA values in x.
 * Wilcoxon tests no longer produce double warning messages when some rows have no remaining observations.

CHANGES:

 * Null-mean and null-ratio arguments are now more consistent across functions: previously named `mu` and `ratio`, now consistently named `null`.
 * The position of `null` argument is now more consistent across functions: `null` always comes before the `alternative` argument.
 * `row_ievora` and `col_ievora` functions are removed. ievora method is a simple application of a Bartlett's test followed by a Student's t-test and can be performed manually.
 * `Inf` values in `wilcox_*` tests are no longer removed but treated as highest ranks in order to be consistent with base R 4.0.0. implementation.
 * Missing argument errors no longer reference `force()` in their error messages.

INTERNAL:

 * matrixTests no longer depends on `testthat` for unit tests.
 * All unit tests were rewritten.
