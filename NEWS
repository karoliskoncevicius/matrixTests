Package: matrixTests
====================

Version 0.2.1 [2023 Apr 20]


INTERNAL:

 * Slight speed improvements of various tests in cases with large sample sizes.


Version 0.2.0 [2023 Apr 07]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Anderson-Darling test: `row_andersondarling` and `col_andersondarling`.
 * Setting conf.level to NA now turns off confidence intervals and improves computation speed.

BUG FIXES:

 * Wilcoxon two-sample test no longer causes integer overflow on large sample sizes.
 * Waerden and Flinger-Killeen tests no longer produce NA results when a whole group has only NA values in x.
 * Wilcoxon tests no longer produce double warning messages when some rows have no remaining observations.
 * Paired t-test no longer returns var.diff = 0 when all paired observations are missing.
 * Warnings are now more robust in correctly deciding between row and column messages.

CHANGES:

 * Null-mean and null-ratio arguments are now more consistent across functions: previously named `mu` and `ratio`, now consistently named `null`.
 * The position of `null` argument is now more consistent across functions: `null` always comes before the `alternative` argument.
 * `row_ievora` and `col_ievora` functions are removed. ievora method is a simple application of a Bartlett's test followed by a Student's t-test and can be performed manually.
 * `Inf` values in `wilcox_*` tests are no longer removed but treated as highest ranks in order to be consistent with base R 4.0.0. implementation.
 * Cosinor gets a separate warning for the case where all observations come from the same time-point within the specified period.
 * Missing argument errors no longer reference `force()` in their error messages.
 * Warning message about constant values in rows are now consistent between tests.
 * Warning message about too few remaining observations are now more consistent between wilcoxon and t tests.
 * When a test cannot be executed all test-specific outputs (test statistic, standard error, and degrees of freedom, not just p-values and confidence intervals as before) are now turned to NA for that row/column.

INTERNAL:

 * Slight speed improvements of all tests in cases with sample sizes bigger than 100.
 * Improved the speed of Wilcox tests, specially in cases with ties.
 * van der Waerden test is now aligned and tested against `PMCMRplus::vanWaerdenTest()` (previously `PMCMR::vanWaerden.test()`).
 * matrixTests no longer depends on `testthat` for unit tests.
 * All unit tests are rewritten.


Version 0.1.9 [2020 Apr 30]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added van der Waerden test: `row_waerden` and `col_waerden`.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Changed NEWS format to markdown.


Version 0.1.8 [2020 Jan 08]

INTERNAL:

 * Adjusted unit tests to conform with changes in R-devel 4.0.0 for CRAN.


Version 0.1.7 [2019 Nov 05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Cosinor test: `row_cosinor` and `col_cosinor`.


Version 0.1.6 [2019 Sep 19]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Levene test: `row_levene` and `col_levene`.
 * Added Brown-Forsythe test: `row_brownforsythe` and `col_brownforsythe`.


Version 0.1.5 [2019 Jul 09]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added F-test for variance: `row_f_var` and it's column equivalent.

INTERNAL:

 * Various speed improvements across all types of tests.
 * Added missing tests for warnings about NA values in "group" argument.


Version: 0.1.4 [2019 Jun 25]

INTERNAL:

 * Improved the speed of Wilcoxon and Kruskal Wallis tests.
 * Improved the speed of Oneway and Bartlett tests.
 * Added run time benchmarks.
 * Expanded test coverage to include all lines within code at least once.
 * Added more tests for ties in `row_kruskalwallis`.


Version: 0.1.3 [2019 Jun 10]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Wilcoxon tests: `row_wilcox_onesample`, `row_wilcox_paired` and `row_wilcox_twosample` plus column version equivalents.

BUG FIXES:

 * Warning messages for column-wise functions no longer warn about rows and specifies columns instead.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Small adjustments to some documentation files (spelling mistakes, ordering, etc).


Version: 0.1.2 [2019 Apr 05]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Added Jarque Bera test: `row_jarquebera` and `col_jarquebera`.
 * Added Fligner-Killeen test: `row_flignerkilleen` and `col_flignerkilleen`.

BUG FIXES:

 * The warning messages are no longer repeated 3 times in cases when the call has a namespace (i.e. `matrixTests::row_bartlett`).


Version: 0.1.1 [2019 Mar 15]

CHANGES:

 * `row_ievora` and `col_ievora` "g" (group) parameter was renamed to "b" (binary).

INTERNAL:

 * Fixed an indexing bug in `row_cor_pearson()` monte-carlo unit testing step.

DOCUMENTATION:

 * Improved help documentation.


Version: 0.1.0 [2018 Mar 5]

NEW FEATURES:

 * Created and submitted to CRAN.
